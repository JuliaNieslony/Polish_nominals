# Polish nominals

With the help of distributional semantics, characteristics of the Polish noun system are explored with a focus on the relationship between case and number. 
At first, a generative model was produced in *julia* code to statistically yield predictions about Polish inflectional mechanisms
Using *t-SNE*, semantic and morphological properties are brought to light by a clustering analysis facilitated by the modeling of multidimensional *fasttext* vectors in a general vector as well as a shift vector analysis taking the factors of case, number, gender and semantic categories into account.
All findings produced in the study allowed implications about the additive vector model and its applicability for the Polish nominal system.
